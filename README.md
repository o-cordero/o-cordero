- 👋 Hi, I’m Omar Cordero (@o-cordero).
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about the world through data. I am a Data Analyst in the making.  Although in my humble opinion learning code and data will be life-long and I don't anticipate nor do i foresee a final goal line in my learning journey.
- My background is in Economics via university and Operations Management by vocation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, sql, visulizations, and programming tools via a data analysis course I will complete in April 2024.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data projects in the future.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I write for a variety of things including small business marketing.
